We split a matrix into several square matrices and transpose them each.
Ideally, we can reduce cache misses from N^2 + N to N.
N means the dimension of the matrix.

I measured the time it took to transpose a 1024 * 1024 matrix 1000 times.
The result are shown below.

| Block size | Time (s)  |
| ---------- | --------- |
| original   | 9.248775  |
| 1024       | 8.812757  |
| 512        | 4.048950  |
| 256        | 3.680387  |
| 128        | 3.475990  |
| 64         | 3.719718  |
| 32         | 5.390352  |
| 16         | 5.471023  |
| 8          | 5.211244  |
| 4          | 4.926171  |
| 2          | 7.076150  |
| 1          | 13.061631 |
