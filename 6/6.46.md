We split a matrix into several square matrices and transpose them each.
In addition, we can reduce memory access by using two-way loop unrolling.

I measured the time it took to transpose a 1024 * 1024 matrix 1000 times.
The result are shown below.

| Block size | Time (s)  |
| ---------- | --------- |
| original   | 20.547876 |
| 1024       | 20.793563 |
| 512        | 4.456019  |
| 256        | 3.804528  |
| 128        | 3.649428  |
| 64         | 3.525911  |
| 32         | 4.224791  |
| 16         | 2.998001  |
| 8          | 3.467111  |
| 4          | 2.879445  |
